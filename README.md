### Application Usage
We created an app for musicians to be able to meet up and jam together. You can create a profile and search for other musicians based on their instrument and style, pick a place and time to meet up and then jam! 


### Technologies Used
-React
-Passport
  -Login authentication with hashed passwords 
-Bootstrap
-Express
-Javascript
-MongoDB/Mongoose
-HTML/CSS


## How It Works

The first page or homepage you is the log in page. If you already have an account you can enter to your profile.  

If you do not have an account you can create one! 


## Profile Page:
Through a simple form you can input all of your information so that active users can find you and schedule a jam session!

## Active Users Page:
Scan through users to see their instrument, styles and skill level to match up and create a group. Click on the person that matches most and the populate into a jam session. From there you can pick a time and place to meet up and jam! 

### The Future
- Search for users based on their instrument, style and skill level
- Be able to chat with active users online in order to schedule your jam session
- Add in your music samples through Soundcloud or Spotify


## Thank you!
